This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Pollage 
[pollage on vercel](https://pollage.vercel.app)
Simple website to create polls. Made this to practice t3 stack (trpc, prisma, nextjs, planetscale)
## Getting Started
you would have to have to have you own [planetscale](https://auth.planetscale.com/sign-up) db to run this locally
run the development server:

```bash
npm i #install required dependencies
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
### TODO
 - [x] use cookies or fingerprinting to prevent multiple votes on same device
 - [ ] use websockets to live update polls
